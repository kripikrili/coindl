<h2 id="quickstart">A Quickstart Guide to Getting Started with Bitcoin</h2>

<p>People discredit Bitcoin as being too confusing simply because it's new and they don't understand it. Here's how simple it can be getting started with Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Keyword(s): getting started with bitcoin</p>

<p>So, you've heard about Bitcoin, AKA <a href="/blog/">"The Currency Of The Future,"</a> in the news.</p>

<p>You know it's important.</p>

<p>You know it has something do to with the Internet. </p>

<p>You may even know that it has gained value at a rate that is <a href="/selling-digital-downloads-for-bitcoin/">four times faster</a> than the Russian Ruble. </p>

<p>But other than that...you really don't know a whole lot about it. </p>

<p>You've thought about getting started with Bitcoin, but you just want a little bit more of an understanding of what you're getting into. </p>

<p>We get it: a lot of the press surrounding Bitcoin is confusing. But in reality, the process of getting started with Bitcoin isn't nearly as tough as it's made out to be.  </p>

<p>In this post, we'll break down in plain English just how simple <a href="/about-coindl/">getting started with Bitcoin</a> actually is. </p>

<p>We'll also help to define more of what Bitcoin is, and why it's a great time to start getting involved with it. </p>

<p>Let's start demystifying Bitcoin now!</p>

<h2 id="brief">A Brief History Of Bitcoin </h2>

<p>Before we talk about getting started with Bitcoin, let's first do a little history lesson. </p>

<p>Bitcoin first started in 2009. It was created by a person named Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<p>OK, so, that's not their real name.</p>

<p>Since its inception, there have been <a href="/what-is-bitcoin-mining/">hundreds of articles</a>, <a href="/ledger-review/">posts</a>, and <a href="/hardware-wallets/">wild conspiracy theories</a> about who exactly this person is. </p>

<p>We still don't know. </p>

<p>But that's really not important. </p>

<p>What matters more is understanding how Bitcoin works, and why it's so valuable. </p>

<p>It's a cryptocurrency, which means it's digital/virtual money. </p>

<p>Also, it's decentralized. That means, in the words of Nakamoto, that there is <a href="/armory-review/">"no server or central authority."</a> Essentially, it's a peer-based network, with exchanges between users. </p>

<p>This also means that getting started with Bitcoin won't require Bitcoin holders to use the currency under their real names. </p>

<p>There are no "Bitcoin banks" and therefore, zero transaction fees. </p>

<p>Since Bitcoin's exception, many other cryptocurrencies have been created. You might hear them referred to as "altcoins" - an alternative to Bitcoins. </p>

<h2 id="becoming">Why Are Bitcoins Becoming Popular? </h2>

<p>The next step in getting started with Bitcoin is understanding why so many people want to use them. </p>

<p>After all, when you invent an entirely new currency and make it available only on the Internet, anonymously - you're bound to raise suspicion. </p>

<p>However, the reality is that the vast majority of Bitcoin use isn't bad at all. </p>

<p>You know just how much of a concern privacy is in today's world - epsecially online. </p>

<p>Changes being made to Internet privacy laws, the possibilities of selling your information, and more are <a href="/buy-bitcoin-with-sepa-transfer/">always in the news</a>. </p>

<p>Bitcoins mean that you can buy what you want to online anonymously. They got their start as the regularly accepted currency of the Deep Web.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, <a href="/buy-bitcoin-with-paypal/">the Deep Web</a> is known for the ability to let you buy what you need to without anyone looking over your shoulder. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is also super helpful to those who need to make frequent payments to international vendors and companies. Since Bitcoins aren't the currency of a single country, they don't fall under any restrictions. </p>

<p>Other people (smartly) see Bitcoins as an awesome investment opportunity. </p>

<p>Smaller businesses use them because they're sick of paying crazy high credit card fees. </p>

<p>Some people just use them because - let's face it - they're cool. </p>

<p>The reality is that Bitcoins are a convenient, smart way to do business - and today, more and more businesses accept them, across a variety of industries. </p>

<p>Yes, even <a href="/buy-bitcoin-with-no-verification/">your favorite pizza place</a>. </p>

<p>Now that you know about why Bitcoins are so popular, and understand more of how they work (see, it wasn't that hard!) let's talk about actually getting started with Bitcoin. </p>

<h2 id="first">Getting Started With Bitcoin: First Steps</h2>

<p>Obviously, the first step you'll take on the exciting road of getting started with Bitcoin is finding where you can get the coins themselves!</p>

<p>But first, let's back up. </p>

<p>Where do you keep your "regular" money? In your wallet, of course!</p>

<p>Well, with Bitcoin, it's exactly the same idea. You need to get a Bitcoin Wallet. </p>

<p>To do this, check out sites like <a href="/buy-bitcoin-with-credit-card/">Coinbase</a> - they're totally beginner-friendly. </p>

<p>Your wallet is actually <a href="/buy-bitcoin-with-cash/">software</a>, and it's how you store and spend your Bitcoins. </p>

<p>Think of it as a kind of digital bank account - that is most definitely not FDIC insured!</p>

<p>These wallets can either be stored in your computer, or in a digital cloud for safekeeping. </p>

<p>Once you get your Bitcoin Wallet, you'll also be given a unique Bitcoin Address. </p>

<p>This is essentially an email address, except instead of getting emails, you're getting Bitcoins sent to your Bitcoin Address. </p>

<p>OK, so it's not exactly like an email address - but the concept is the same. </p>

<p>It really looks more like a password or a barcode. Your Bitcoin Address is a longer string of numbers and letters beginning with either a 1 or a 3. </p>

<p>Now that you've got your wallet and you're Bitcoin Address, let's discuss how you can get your hands on the currency itself!</p>

<h2 id="second">Getting Started With Bitcoin: Where Can I Buy Them? </h2>

<p>Just like there are lots of things you can buy with Bitcoin, there are also lots of ways to get your hands on them! </p>

<p>You can find Bitcoins for sale on Bitcoin Exchanges, and you can buy as many Bitcoins as you want using the currency of your choice in most cases. </p>

<p>On average, a Bitcoin is valued currently at a little over 1,000 USD. </p>

<p>If you don't have $1,000 just sitting around, don't panic. You can also buy fractions of Bitcoins. </p>

<p>Keep in mind too, when you're getting started with Bitcoin, that if you use a credit card or a system like Paypal, that you'll likely have to pay a lot higher fees. </p>

<p>Using traceable methods of payment, AKA "Reversible Payment Types," can put your seller at risk. </p>

<p>Remember that the whole point of getting started with Bitcoin is to keep things anonymous. </p>

<p>If possible, it's much better to use what's called an "Irreversible Payment Type." </p>

<p>That would be something like a wire transfer. </p>

<p>That way, your seller - and you - are both much more protected in the marketplace. </p>

<h2 id="third">Getting Started With Bitcoin: Understanding Mining</h2>

<p>Another aspect you need to understand in the beginning is the concept of Bitcoin "mining," which is a term you'll hear thrown around a lot when you're getting started. </p>

<p>Mining is basically a competition that allows you win Bitcoins. </p>

<p>How can you win them? </p>

<p>By mining them - AKA, solving crazy-intense mathematical problems and logic puzzles. This is part of what makes the Bitcoin world so much fun. </p>

<p>It also explains why it's so popular among serious tech types. </p>

<p>This "mining" process also helps to actually generate the Bitcoins themselves. </p>

<p>If you think it's impossible, or that people rarely "win" these mining competitions, think again!</p>

<p>In fact, about once every 10 minutes, someone out there wins about 25 Bitcoins by doing some seriously good mining. </p>

<p>There are tons of tips and tricks related to successfully mining Bitcoins (hey, we happen to think a lot of them are accessible right on our awesome website.) </p>

<h2 id="fourth">What Does The Future Hold For Bitcoin?</h2>

<p>The truth is, nobody really knows!</p>

<p>We think that's part of what makes getting into the Bitcoin game so exciting. </p>

<p>Right now, many feel that we are living in the "Golden Age" of Bitcoin. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Because, as we mentioned earlier, the market is totally unregulated and not subject to any form of government control. </p>

<p>That means - you guessed it - zero taxes. </p>

<p>Who doesn't love that? </p>

<p>But like all good things, many believe this incredible market isn't going to stay the way it is now forever. </p>

<p>That's why there is no time like the present to get your Bitcoin Wallet and Address, buy and mine as many Bitcoins as you can, and start your Bitcoin investment early. </p>

<p>Of course, to invest, mine, save and spend your Bitcoins well, you're going to need expert advice. </p>

<p>But there aren't exactly a ton of Bitcoin brokers out on Wall Street - at least, not yet!</p>

<p>So, where can you find valuable advice, market reports and up-to-the-minute news about all things Bitcoin? </p>

<p>Well, Bitcoin started online, didn't it? </p>

<p>That's where we come in...</p>

<p>We're the people you can trust, and who have the experience to help you make smart choices and stay informed. </p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Start Using Bitcoin</strong></p>
 
<p><center><img src="/images/started-btc-4.jpg" alt="Getting Started with Bitcoin"/></center></p> 
 
<p>We may have known people who got rich because of Bitcoin but it’s not that simple as you think it is. Unless you have the capabilities and resources to take it like in the stock market, it’s difficult to think Bitcoin as a form of investment. The profitability will never be guaranteed that’s why you have to be careful in choosing where to put your money.</p>
 
<p>Several people uses Bitcoin because they think it’s a <a href="/buy-bitcoin-with-credit-card/">very good choice of a digital payment</a>. But since a lot of merchants are arising nowadays, we may feel safe to use Bitcoin with anyone who is willing to accept it. No laws exist on ways that merchants should accept Bitcoin so you acquire it only from stores that uses a trusted and reliable gateway for payment.</p>
 
<p>BitPay is known to be the most secured option for payment today. Newegg as well as other business and organizations more than 50,000 in number around the world relies on it.</p>

<p>BitPay is even good enough for companies such as Microsoft, Wordpress and other countless companies in the business we deal with, how much for us.</p>
 
<p>BitPay guarantees any store who uses it for Bitcoin transaction to be safe and secure. But since there are still a number of available payment gateway out there, remember to use something that is legit. If you’re not so sure, then better do some background check.</p>

<h2 id="started">Getting Started</h2>
 
<p>Educate yourself. Using Bitcoin can be confusing at first since it differs from any other currency you may have used before. That is why it is very vital to know important key points. Not like the money issued by the government that undergoes inflation at will, Bitcoin’s supply limits only to 21,000,000 Bitcoins which will never change.</p>
 
<p>Counterfeiting or inflation can <a href="/buy-bitcoin-with-sepa-transfer/">never happened in Bitcoins</a>. It can be used for money sending and receiving with anyone and anywhere across the globe for a very cheap price. Bitcoin is everywhere. It can’t  be blocked and you cannot freeze Bitcoin wallets as well. In short, Bitcoin network can never be stopped and it is uncensorable even if you turn off the  all the internet around the world.</p>

<p>The Need To Have a Wallet. Although there are <a href="/hardware-wallets/">several various options</a>, deciding for a wallet is just simple. What is essential is to know is your self control ability when it comes to keeping your Bitcoins just like a real cash in your wallet or the need the help for someone else to hold it instead. </p>

<p>Both ways have positive and negative impacts but generally we opted for users to hold it personally. You can own as much Bitcoin wallets as you can but it would be good to start with having a wallet for your Android or iPhone devices so it is readily available everywhere you are. Wallets can be chosen here.</p>
 
<p>Start Acquiring Bitcoins. <a href="/armory-review/">Acquiring Bitcoins</a> just like having any other currency works by selling something that you own for them. You can be paid by your current employer with Bitcoin upon their permission. A payroll service which is Bitcoin based, like Bitwage can be readily used without having to inform your employer. </p>

<p>It can also be used as a medium for payment with your business. But above all, you can easily have Bitcoins through buying from any legit Bitcoin exchanges.</p>
 
<p>Perks of Using Bitcoins. Who doesn’t want to spend Bitcoins? A 20% discount is available for everything at Amazon through Purse.io and also a 20% off in every Starbucks transaction through WeUseCoins.com will also guide you to look for a near local place that accepts Bitcoin.
