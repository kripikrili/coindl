<h2 id="wallet">Bitcon Wallet</h2>

<p>The primary <a href="/blog/">step to use Bitcoin</a> is to have a bitcoin wallet.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Without the wallet, nobody can store, receive and spend bitcoins.</p>

<p>In the Bitcoin network, the wallet is considered your personal interface; the same setup with your bank account online is an interface with the usual monetary system.</p>

<p>Bitcoin wallets have private keys; secret codes enabling you to use your bitcoins.</p>

<p>In real life, it’s not really the bitcoins that needs to be secured and stored, but it’s the private keys that are important since it’s give you access to them.</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<p>A <a href="/best-bitcoin-exchanges/">BTC wallet</a> is really just a website, device or an app that manages private keys of Bitcoin for you.</p>
 
<h2 id="types">Bitcoin Wallet Types</h2>

<p>Let us talk about the different bitcoin wallet types and why you should choose one kind instead of the other.</p>

<p><h4>Hardware Wallets</h4></p>

<p>An actual electronic device, a hardware wallet is created mainly with the intention of securing bitcoins.</p>

<p>The central idea is before you can able to spend your bitcoins, the hardware wallet should be connected to your phone, tablet or computer.</p>

<p>The three best and most famous BTC hardware wallets are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trezor</p></li>
<li><p>Ledger Nano S</p></li>
<li><p>KeepKey</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a person who takes convenience and security seriously as well as the reliability of Bitcoin storage, then hardware wallets is really the best choice.</p>

<p>The BTC hardware wallets store private keys distinct from susceptible, internet-connected devices.</p>

<p>All your important private keys are retained in a safe offline environment inside the hardware wallet, hundred percent protected even if the device is plugged into a computer that is malware-infected.</p>

<p>Since bitcoins are digital, <a href="/coinbase-review/">cyber criminals</a> could possibly prey the “software wallet” of your computer and access your private keys to steal them.</p>

<p>The process of generating and keeping private keys offline by the use of a hardware wallet, makes certain that there’s no way hackers can reach to your bitcoins.</p>

<p>Hackers then have to steal primarily the hardware wallet, but even then, a PIN code protection is still there.</p>

<p>Do not mind about the hardware wallet being lost, damaged or stolen either; as long as a secret backup code is created, bitcoins can always be retrieved.</p>

<p><h4>Reasons why hardware wallets are good:</h4></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Simplest way to securely keep bitcoins</p></li>
<li><p>Easy to secure and backup</p></li>
<li><p>Margin for error is less; easy to setup even for non-technical users</p></li>
</ul>

<p><h4>Reasons why hot wallets are good:</h4></p>

<p>Simplest way small bitcoin amounts can be stored</p>
<p>Convenient; payment receiving and spending is fast and easy</p>
<p>Access to funds in multiple devices are allowed on some hot wallets</p>

<p><h4>Reason why hot wallets are bad:</h4></p>

<h2 id="billion">Bitcoin Banks: $1 Billion Lost in Hacks</h2>
 
<p>Another thing to remember regarding bitcoin wallets is that there’s a distinction between a bank and a wallet. Some users of bitcoin see Coinbase as a wallet, but this company functions much more like a bank.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>

<p>The private keys primarily are the most important things users need to secure to run the bitcoin network safely without getting hacked. By the time you give somebody else control of your private keys; you are just like depositing at a financial institution – in other words like depositing at any bank.</p>

<p>This doesn’t imply that banks of bitcoin are inherently bad. Coinbase and other companies have done a lot of things to attract more customers in the ecosystem. It’s simply vital to take note that whoever has control of the private keys automatically control the attached bitcoins to those keys.</p>

<p>Due to a misunderstanding of this topic has contributed to the loss of hundreds of millions in US dollars in the past, so it’s very vital to know and understand deeply the huge difference in how private keys in Bitcoin can be stored.</p>
 
<p>Enough knowledge about how bitcoin wallets operate is a very important element to use safely this new technology.  Bitcoin is currently in its younger years of development so wallets in time will be much friendlier to the users.</p>

<p>Futuristically, some devices will eventually come with wallets that are pre-installed that will interact together with the blockchain without even the knowledge of the user.</p>

<p>So far, it’s important to note that private keys are the one you need to safely secure if you wish to keep safely your bitcoin from user errors, hackers and other issues possible.</p>
 
<h2 id="theft">Theft and Scams</h2>

<p>No matter what wallet you select, take note:</p>

<p>Your bitcoins will be safe only through the private keys that were securely generated, remained a secret and most especially controlled by no other person but YOU!</p>

<p>These are the two examples in which users lost a lot because of leaving their bitcoins in a third party hand: </p>

<p>The Bitfinex hack, where seventy million dollars was lost from the users</p>

<p>The Mt Gox failure, where four-hundred fifty million dollars or more was lost from users</p>

<p>To prevent scams, theft and any other forms of fund loss, take note of these three (3) basic principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1. Create your private keys through a secure and offline environment. (Except for cases where your keys are made by a hot wallet, like trivial amounts)</p></li>

<li><p>2. Secure your private keys through a backup. This assists in protecting against bitcoin loss due to failure of hard drive or some other accident or problems. In an ideal setup, the backup should be in a duplicate set that’s kept in another site in cases where there’s robbery, fire, etc.</p></li>

<li><p>3. Hide wallets to give additional security. This will help in the prevention of stealing your funds physically in cases where your hardware wallet or device is stolen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Securing bitcoins safely is the most vital step for any users of Bitcoin.  </p>

<p>Having bitcoins does not only give you a privilege but the responsibility as well to <a href="/buy-bitcoin-with-paypal/">safely guard your own money</a>. There is innumerable scam that is Bitcoin related that should have been avoided and prevented if the people did not entrust their bitcoins to others.</p>

<p>It’s a perfect rule not to ever trust someone especially with regards to money.</p>
